\begin{document}
In this project, we are interested in pointed, polyhedral rational cones, which are a special case of polyhedra. Here, we will give rigorous definitions, which are the foundations necessary to discuss the computational experimentation. While the following definitions are general and can be applied to any vector space with an inner product, we are in particular interested in $\R^d$.
