\begin{document}
We shall now build the definition for normal polytope, which are important objects in combinatorial commutative algebra and toric algebraic geometry. The study of these objects in a fixed dimension $d$, denoted $\mathrm{NPol}(d)$ as a partially ordered set is the direct motivation leading to the cone conjecture.

%We then define an affine lattice generated by the lattice points in $P$:
%$$ L = \{ z \in \Z^d: z = v + \sum_{x,y \in P \cap Z^d}\Z(x-y) \text{ for some } v \in P \cap \Z^d\}$$  Note that $P \cap L  = P \cap \Z^d$.
%\begin{definition}{Normal polytope}
%A lattice polytope $P$ is \emph{integrally closed} if it satisfies the following condition:
%$$ c \in \N, z \in cP \cap \Z^d \implies \exists x_1 , \ldots x_c \in P \cap \Z^d \ST x_1 + \cdots + x_c = z $$
%\end{definition}
%This means that for every point $z$ in a $c$ dilation of $P$, there are $c$ lattice points $x_1,\ldots,x_c$ in $P$ such that $z$ is the sum of these points $c$.


\begin{definition}[Normal polytope]
A lattice polytope $P$ is \emph{normal} if it satisfies the following condition:
$$ n \in \Z_+, z \in \mathrm{L}(nP) \implies \exists x_1 , \ldots x_n \in \mathrm{L}(P) \ST x_1 + \cdots + x_n = z.$$
$\Z_+$ here denote the positive integers.
\end{definition}

In other words, a lattice polytope $P$ is normal if the lattice elements of the $n$-th dilate of $P$ is the Minkowski sum of $n$ copies of the lattice points of $P$.
\begin{remark}
In some texts, where a lattice polytope is defined using an affine lattice instead of $\Z^d$, there is a technical distinction between \emph{integrally closed} and \emph{normal}. Specifically, a polytope $P$ is integrally closed if and only if $P$ is normal and the affine lattice of $P$ is a direct summand of $\Z^d$ \cite{GubeladzeNormalPolytopeSurvey}.

Normal polytopes have been an object of study since the 1990's. A precursor to this is Pick's theorem from the 19th century which, when reworded in the modern and generalized language of normal polytopes, implies that all lattice polygons are normal. However, these objects and their poset structure are highly sensitive to a change in dimension. In higher dimensions, starting with 3, the normal polytopes form a small portion of all lattice polytopes.
