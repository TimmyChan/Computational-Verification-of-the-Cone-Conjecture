Please be aware that if you try to compile the Timmy_Fall_2018_Thesis, that it may take quite a while. TeXmaker is known to time out, even on a "modern" (as of 2018) laptop, the Surfacebook 3 by Microsoft. 

I used the following software in writing the thesis:
- LateX 
- GeoGebra 
- SAGE/Python
- Normaliz
